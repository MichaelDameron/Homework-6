Website link: https://michaeldameron.github.io/Homework-6/

Description: 
This simple weather app will search for the current and 5-day forecast when a user enters a city into the search bar and clicks the search button. The weather info and forecast is gathered from OpenWeather API, displaying current temperature, wind speed, humidity and UV index in the "current conditions" conatiner; and displays the daily high temps, humidity, and weather index icon gathered from bootstrap services int the "5-Day-Forecast" conatiner. 

The names of the cities the user has search for are logged and displayed on the screen under the "search city" form.

This app does cannot distinguish between states that have cities that share the same name. Ex: There is now way to choose Greenville NC, or Greenville SC - yet.


Below are some screenshots of the working application:
